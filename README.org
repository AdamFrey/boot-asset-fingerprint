A boot task to add a cache-busting fingerprint to asset-references in
HTML files.
** FAQ
*** Alternatives?
There is another library [[https://github.com/pointslope/boot-fingerprint][boot-fingerprint]] that
`boot-asset-fingerprint` drew inspiration from. Both libraries use
Enlive's syntax for asset references. As of version `0.1.2-SNAPSHOT`,
`boot-fingerprint` does not use Boot pods to isolate its dependencies
on Enlive and Pandect. It uses deprecated boot core functions. And
also it has no built in caching, so it will re-run the fingerprint
task on your html files on each file change regardless of whether any
html file changed.
